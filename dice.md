| Level| Points | Uses |
| ------ |:------:|------|
| Medium | 2 | LEDs, Button |

## Mission

Make your Engduino into a dice. Press the button to roll the dice.

## You will need
* An Engduino.
* The ** ENGDUINO LIBRARIES: THE LEDS ** sheet.
* The ** ENGDUINO LIBRARIES: THE BUTTON ** sheet.
* The ** ENGDUINO LIBRARIES: FOR LOOPS ** sheet.

## Method
1. Read the ** ENGDUINO LIBRARIES: THE LEDS **, ** ENGDUINO LIBRARIES: THE BUTTON ** and ** ENGDUINO LIBRARIES: FOR LOOPS ** sheet.
3. Open a new sketch.
4. Save the sketch with a new name: ```dice```.
5. Generate a random value for the dice throw using the ```random``` function. The random function returns a random number in a range you specify like this:
	```
	int throw =  random(0,7);

	```
	This code returns a random number in the range that is one less than the second number in the brackets.

6. Use a ```for loop`` to light up the right number of LEDs.
8. Use the button to start the dice roll. 

Continue until you have completed the challenge.
