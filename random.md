# Task 2.4: Random LEDs 
| Level| Points | Uses |
| ------ |:------:|------|
| Medium | 2 | LEDs |

## Mission

Make random LEDs turn on.
## You will need
* An Engduino.
* The ** ENGDUINO LIBRARIES: THE LEDS ** sheet.

## Method
1. Read the ** ENGDUINO LIBRARIES: THE LEDS ** sheet.
3. Open a new sketch.
4. Save the sketch with a new name: ```randomLEDs```.
5. You need to make a random LED light up. To do this you will need to use the ```random``` function. The random function returns a random
number in a range you specify like this:
	```
	int i =  random(0,16);

	```
	This code returns a random number between 0 and 15 - that's one less than the top of the range you specified.

6. Make the LED in position ```i``` light up.
7. Include a delay and turn all the LEDs off before starting again.



Continue until you have completed the challenge.



Congratulations! Collect your points for this challenge.
